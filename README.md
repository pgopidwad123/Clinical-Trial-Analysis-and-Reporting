# Clinical-Trial-Analysis-and-Reporting
##Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the demographic and baseline characteristics of participants in a randomized clinical trial. The goal is to evaluate patient diversity and ensure balanced treatment groups using statistical summaries and visual representations. The analysis is conducted using SAS programming, a widely used tool in clinical data management and reporting.

The dataset consists of 100 patient records with variables such as age, gender, race, and treatment groups. The study aims to provide insights into patient demographics and ensure proper data representation, forming the foundation for further clinical evaluations and decision-making.

##Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:
✅ Analyzing age distribution and categorizing participants into age groups (<18, 18–65, >65 years).
✅ Evaluating gender representation within the study population.
✅ Assessing racial composition to ensure inclusivity.
✅ Ensuring proper data structuring for accurate clinical reporting.
✅ Implementing SAS programming for data preprocessing, analysis, and reporting.

##Tools & Technologies Used
🔹 SAS Studio – For data cleaning, processing, and statistical analysis.
🔹 Microsoft Excel / Google Sheets – For initial dataset preparation.
🔹 Canva / Google Drive – For graphical representations of results.
🔹 GitHub – For version control and documentation.

##Dataset Overview
The dataset used for this project includes the following key columns:

STUDY – Clinical study identifier
PATNO – Patient number
SITENO – Site number of the clinical trial
SUBJINI – Subject initials
DIAGDT – Diagnosis date
TRT – Treatment group
DAY, MONTH, YEAR – Birthdate details
GENDER – Male/Female classification
RACE – Participant's racial background
Total dataset size: 100 rows

##Project Workflow
The project follows a structured workflow for data analysis:

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
✔️ Data Import: Uploading the dataset into SAS Studio
✔️ Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and inconsistencies
✔️ Age Calculation: Creating a derived variable for patient age

2️⃣ Statistical Analysis & Feature Engineering
✔️ Age Distribution Analysis: Computing mean, standard deviation, min, max values
✔️ Age Group Categorization: Dividing participants into <18, 18–65, and >65 categories
✔️ Gender Representation: Analyzing male vs. female distribution
✔️ Racial Composition Analysis: Examining inclusivity in the dataset

3️⃣ Data Transformation & Structuring
✔️ Stacking and Merging Data: Combining multiple statistics for comprehensive insights
✔️ Fixing Precision Points: Standardizing decimal points for consistency
✔️ Data Transposition: Structuring data horizontally based on treatment groups

4️⃣ Final Reporting
✔️ Ordering Data: Aligning statistical parameters in a structured format
✔️ Adding Treatment Groups: Differentiating patient responses across study arms
✔️ Generating Final Report: Creating a structured SAS-based summary report

##Key Findings
🔹 Balanced Age Distribution – Majority of patients fall within the 18–65 category, ensuring a representative sample.
🔹 Gender Representation – The study includes a near-equal split between male and female participants, reducing bias.
🔹 Racial Diversity – The dataset ensures inclusivity by featuring multiple racial groups.
🔹 Statistically Sound Data – Proper methodologies were used to validate demographic balance and accuracy.

##Conclusion
This project successfully analyzes demographic trends in a clinical trial dataset, ensuring a well-balanced population sample for future medical research. The results validate the trial’s inclusivity and generalizability, making it suitable for subsequent treatment efficacy assessments.

By leveraging SAS programming, the project provides structured insights into clinical trial data, offering a reliable foundation for future studies and regulatory reporting.
